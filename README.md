This repository contains a discord bot that I use in a discord server I run with my friends.
As of now, I run it using node.js on the windows powershell.
In the near future, I plan to purchase a raspberry pi to use as a server for the bot to run on.
This way my computer doesn't have to be on for my bot to be online.
