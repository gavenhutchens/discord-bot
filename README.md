# discord-bot
This is a bot that I've been working on in my spare time. I'm currently in the process of updating
it to include a wide variety of functionalities.


## Necessary installations

Install nodejs:

```
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Install the package manager:

```
sudo apt install npm
```

ffmpeg binaries, these are needed to connect to a voice channel
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### Other prereqs

Make sure when registering a bot with discord that you 
obtain a token value. This value should be stored in a
secure location, and **never** be put on github or any
other public location.



### Running the bot:

```
node app.js
```
